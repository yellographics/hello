Welcome to my profile! I am a curious and passionate front-end developer (beginner). I have been studying and practicing this incredibly interesting area for almost a 1,5+ year now. Can't wait to start working on cool projects. In the meantime, look what I've been learning all this time

## Besides that ...
I got a Trainee position, where I was able to lear Angular, RxJs and testing tools such as Jasmine/Jest. I worked on a banking project, developing new features with Angular, reviewing colleauges' code and discussing my work with a team (BA, QA, UX Designers and Backend developers).

## What I plan to do next

- strengthen my knowledge in JS, TypeScript and Angular
- become a part of a great team and create effective and fast, user-friendly web applications :)
